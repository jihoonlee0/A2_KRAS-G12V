Code for the manuscript <b>Overcoming immune evasion from post-translational modification of a mutant KRAS epitope to achieve TCR-engineered T cell-mediated antitumor activity</b> by Lee JW, Chen EY, Hu T, Perret R, Chaffee ME, Martinov T, Jones LA, Gafken PR, Chanana P, Su Y, Chapuis AG, Bradley P, Schmitt TM, Greenberg PD.

Code is presented for the following components of the paper: 
- Modeling and visualization of pMHC complexes using Rosetta, and of TCR-pMHC complexes using Alphafold and Rosetta
- Sequence analysis of TCR mutant libraries from next-generation sequencing data
